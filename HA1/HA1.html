					<h3>A Favorite Visualization</h3>
					<div class="image">
					    <a href="./images/indian-elections-family-ties.jpeg"><img src="./images/indian-elections-family-ties.jpeg" alt="Nepotism in Indian Politics and Elections" /></a>
					</div>
					<div>
					    <p>
						<span class="halabel">Describe the visualization:</span>
					        The above visualization is about the Nepotism in the current Indian Politics by "The Hindu" newspaper. 
					    </p>
					    <p>
						<span class="halabel">Why did you choose it?</span> 
					       India is due for it's General Elections in 2019. I chose this particular visualization because it has caught my attention in illustrating the nepotism imbibed in the Indian Political System. This clearly shows that atleast 130 members of parliament are from political families. This trend may continue even in the 2019 General Elections in India.
